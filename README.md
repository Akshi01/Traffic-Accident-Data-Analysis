### Key Findings:
- Accident Metrics:
Total accidents: 308,000
Total casualties: 418,000

Sundays, despite fewer accidents, have the highest fatalities, indicating potential reckless driving.
- Daily Patterns:
Accidents peak around 9 am, 3 pm, and 6 pm, coinciding with rush hours.
- Road Type Impact:
75% of accidents occur on single-carriageway roads, where lane separation is minimal.
- Junctions Influence:
T-junctions and staggered junctions have the highest accident rates, highlighting the need for improved signage.
- Traffic Control:
Uncontrolled traffic areas experience the most accidents, emphasizing the importance of authorized traffic management.
- Vehicle Involvement:
Cars (private or taxi) are involved in 84% of accidents, reflecting their prevalence on roads.
- Monthly Trends:
Accidents decreased in 2021 compared to 2020, but November shows a peak, possibly due to holiday season traffic.

### Recommendations
